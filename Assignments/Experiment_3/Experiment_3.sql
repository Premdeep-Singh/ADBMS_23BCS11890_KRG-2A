 -In a bustling corporate organization, each department strives to retain the most talented
(and well-compensated) employees. You have access to two key records: one lists every employee
along with their salary and department, while the other details the names of each department. Your
task is to identify the top earners in every department.
If multiple employees share the same highest salary within a department, all of them should be
celebrated equally. The final result should present the department name, employee name, and
salary of these top-tier professionals arranged by department. (Medium Level)*/
